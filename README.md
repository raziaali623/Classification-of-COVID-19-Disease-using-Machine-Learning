Nowadays the deadly virus famous as COVID-19 spread all over the world starts from the Wuhan China in 2019. This disease COVID-19 Virus affects millions of people in a very short time. There are so many symptoms of COVID19 that perhaps the Identification of a person infected with   COVID-19 virus is really a difficult task. Moreover, itâ€™s a challenging task to identify whether a person or individual has a covid19 test positive or negative. Likewise, there are so many other diseases that sometimes need to focus on with covid19 testing just like diabetic patients need to focus on during this process. 
. The experimental results of covid19 showed the best accuracy obtained from Decision Tree classifiers. The data preprocessing techniques have been applied for improving classification performance. Recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score metrics parameters were used to evaluate the classification performance. As compared to previous research, the accuracy of the proposed model is 93%.
